<h1>CS7NS5/CSU44032 Security and Privacy - Exam replacement in 2020</h1>

<p>Due to current circumstances, we're not having an exam. Instead we will
have a set of assignments, but those are designed to be as similar as
possible to the usual exam for this module, specifically:

<ul>
    <li>I will set 4 new assignments (ER1 to ER4) in blackboard. Each assignment
        will map to what is normally an exam question. That is, assignment ER1 will
        look like question 1 in a typical exam (so will be about risk analysis), 
        assignment ER2 will be like question 2 (so will be about key management
        protocols like TLS), etc.
        <ul>
            <li>Old exams can be seen <a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/old-exams/index.html">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Course materials are <a href="https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/cs7053/">here</a>
                and on <a href="https://github.com/sftcd/cs7053">github</a>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Students will need to complete 3 of those 4 new assignments, in the same
        way that the typcial exam requires attempting 3 of 4 questions.</li>
    <li>The assignments will be published at noon Irish Summer Time (UTC+1) on 
        Friday April 17th.</li>
    <li>There is a <strong>hard</strong> deadline of Monday May 11th 23:59 UTC+1 for 
        submission of all assignments.</li>
    <li>For each assignment completed, a <strong>separate</strong> PDF file 
        MUST be submitted. DO NOT submit text for more than one assignment in one 
        file/submission.</li>
    <li>Students are expected to spend about 2 hours to complete each of the
        three assignments to be attempted, that is, a total of about 6 hours.</li>
    <li>Compared to dealing with a typical exam, marking will be adjusted 
        to cater for the ability to use online resources, but also taking
        into account the disrupted end-of-year.</li>
    <li>Submissions will be run through anti-plagiarism tooling. Real cases of
        substantive plagiarism will be dealt with applying school/college policies.
        Don't worry about self-plagiarism scores due to boilerplate text such
        as front-pages etc.</li>
    <li>Please include the declaration about plagiarism that was sent to you
        in email with <strong>every</strong> assignment submission.</li>
    <li>You can submit as many times as you like. Only the last submission
        will be marked.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>Students are reminded that recordings of the online lectures since March 11th
are available in blackboard. Content there is relevant for completing assignments!</p>

<p>Any questions: contact me via <a href="mailto:stephen.farrell@cs.tcd.ie">email</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have a blackboard "collab" session to discuss this on Friday April 10th at
1300 Irish Summer Time (UTC+1). That'll be recorded.</p>

<p>Notes based on questions received:
<ul>
    <li>There is no specific word count required. Make your answers technically sound 
        using as many words as you think are needed. (But don't spend too much time,
        you have other work to do.</li>
</ul>
